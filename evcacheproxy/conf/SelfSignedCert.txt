1) Generate ssl key and self-signed certificate.

    openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -out helloworld.crt -keyout helloworld.key
    Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
    ....++++++
    ......++++++
    writing new private key to 'helloworld.key'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Engineering Tools
    Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:*.amazonaws.com

2) Create a keystore for Tomcat

2a) Combine key and cert into a pkcs12 format (use the string 'changeit' for the password):

    openssl pkcs12 -export -in helloworld.crt -inkey helloworld.key -certfile helloworld.crt -name "tomcat" -out helloworld.p12
    Export Password:
    Verifying - Enter Export Password:

2b) Convert the .p12 file into a JKS (use same password as in previous step):

    keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore helloworld.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore helloworld.keystore -deststoretype JKS
    Enter destination keystore password:  
    Re-enter new password: 
    Enter source keystore password:  
    Entry for alias tomcat successfully imported.
    Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled
